# SmolRenderer
This is a [smol](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Smol) software renderer I'm creating to learn about C++ and computer graphics.

I'm learning about rendering from Dmitry Sokolov's "tinyrenderer" course [here](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer/wiki).

Thanks to [Bence Weisz](https://github.com/BenWeisz) for putting me onto this course.

I also learned more about the Truevision TGA and Wavefront .obj file formats from Paul Bourke's website [here](http://www.paulbourke.net/dataformats/).
